Keeping up to date with the latest technologies and is hard these days. It's the golden age of informational technology and every day something new emerges - tutorials, frameworks, libraries, updates etc. So how to keep you stream of information flow? Here's my experience...

##  My first approach

Searching and reading through numerous resources and websites were a bit tedious, but was doing the job - searching for an hour or two, I would find an interesting post and save it as a bookmark. But after several months, I was left with 200+ bookmarks, that I couldn't manage. It was time for a change.

## And then - RSS readers

I started using [Feedly](http://feedly.com) three years ago. Feedly is a news aggregator application, which compiles news feeds from a variety of online sources for the user to customize and share.

It was great - Feedly was showing me only the websites, that I was interested in and saving the most important posts and news was as easy as clicking "Save". But something was missing. There was still a lot of searching and filtering, so I had no other choice, but to search for even more optimized way.

## Newsletters

The first newsletter I ever encountered was the [Smashing Magazine Newsletter](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/) - every Tuesday, an email with the most interesting post from the website was send to my account. It was perfect - no more searching, filtering and time wasting.

The great thing about newsletters is that you get only the most relevant, up to date news, without being flooded with emails, you can't even read.

So, without any further ado, let me present give you my 2 year's collection of Web and Front-End newsletters:

### [The Changelog](https://changelog.com) - open source moves fast. Keep up.

The Changelog is a member supported blog, weekly newsletter and podcast that covers the intersection of software development and open source. Open source moves fast. Keep up.

### [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com) - a free, once–weekly e-mail round-up of JavaScript news and articles.

One e-mail each Friday with the most interesting news and posts about JavaScript, jobs openings etc.

### [Web Development Reading List](https://wdrl.info) - a handcrafted, carefully selected list of web development related resources.

This project is an attempt to filter and concatenate all the web development links that pop up every single day. The Web Development Reading List aims to filter those links for you so you stay up to date about the latest technologies and techniques but don’t need to read every link you find in the wild.

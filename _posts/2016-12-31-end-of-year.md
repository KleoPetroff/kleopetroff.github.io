It’s been a while I wrote something here, 9 months to be precise and so many things happen during this time. 2016 was a blast for me:

- Started working at Coherent Labs.
- Moved to Sofia.
- [Became a writer at Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/originals).
- Attended several conferences - [BeerJS](https://github.com/beerjs/sofia), [Sofia Game Dev Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Sofia-Game-Dev-Meetup), multiple Dev.bg events.
- [Got recognized as a top contributor of Hashnode for second consecutive year](https://2016.hashnode.com).
- Started reading non-technical literature.
- Finally was able to go on a summer holiday!

## The change

In May I started working at [Coherent Labs](http://coherent-labs.com) and moved to Sofia. I had some difficulties in the beginning, mainly because of the relocation and the adaptation, but after a while, everything fell into place.

The project I’m working on is a graphical UI editor, aimed at helping game designers and programmer make their UIs faster and easier. It’s using web technologies at its core, making it one of the few editors of its kind.

To be honest, I couldn’t be happier right now. If someone told me, one year ago, that I will be working where I’m now, I will most certainly not believe you.

## The writer in me

I’ve been a big fan of Hashnode all back to the times when it was called Devmag. I’ve shared numerous articles and answered so many questions there. Although not that active this year, in September, I was invited to become a writer for Hashnode.

It was a dream come true! My first article - [Zero to One: How I mastered JavaScript and how you can too](https://hashnode.com/post/zero-to-one-how-i-mastered-javascript-and-how-you-can-too-ciuwmrw9j00r50q539clhhdj7) was a total success:

- Over 30K views and almost 100 likes
- Features on several mailing lists.
- 100% positive feedback.

Now, I’m the process of writing my second article. It should be in January, so stay tuned!

## Goodbye 2016, hello 2017

I have big plans for 2017 and I’ve already set resolutions for the new year. And because I know resolutions are easy to be forgotten, I will share them publicly:

- **Learn something new every two weeks and document it** - this is my ultimate challenge for 2017. I will try to learn a new technology every two weeks.
- **Write more blog posts** - I was very inactive this year when it comes to writing here. My last post was at 18th of March. Next year, I plan to be more active and write more - approximate 2-3 blog posts a month.
- **Continue to self-develop** - 2016 was marked as the year I read a lot of technical and non-technical literature. 2017 will be no different. I've made a list of books I want to read and I'm dead set of reading them by the end of the next year.
- **Be more active** - be more active and participate more in Hashnode's community, my local JS community and at work.
- **Travel more** - I couldn't go to most of the places I've wanted this year. [The Seven Rila Lakes](http://bulgariatravel.org/en/object/274/sedemte_rilski_ezera), [Musala](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Musala), [Vihren](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vihren), see you soon :)

Looking back at 2016 I can safely say I'm more than happy of how it went. All the changes, the new people I've met and the places I've gone were really exited. But hey, 2017 - get ready!
